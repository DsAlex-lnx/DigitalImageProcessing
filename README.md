# Digital Image Processing (PDI)

This repository is intended to store and share content taught in Digital Image Processing (PDI) classes. The goal is to provide a practical and theoretical foundation on the various techniques and concepts involved in digital image processing.

## Tools Used

The content is being developed using **Jupyter Notebook**, which is linked to **Visual Studio Code**. This combination provides an interactive and efficient environment for executing code and visualizing results.

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:

- **Pillow**: An image manipulation library that allows opening, editing, and saving different image formats.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision and image processing. It is widely used in applications that require image and video analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: A 2D plotting library used to create graphs and visualizations, allowing for graphical representation of image data.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a wide collection of mathematical functions.

## Repository Structure

- `images/`: Folder containing example images used in PDI practices.
- `resources/`: Contains resources to be used in classes, such as mathematical formulas, illustrative images related to the subject, PDFs, etc.
- `notebooks/`: Folder containing the Jupyter Notebooks used in the classes.
